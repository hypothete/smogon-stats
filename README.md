# Smogon Stats

A rough browser for "chaos" files from https://www.smogon.com/stats/ . Adding pokemon to your party recalculates a "synergy" value for each party member, based on how often the various mons are found on each others teams in the data.

## How to use

`yarn` to install, then `yarn start` to start the dev server.

Download a file of interest from Smogon Stats, and then browse through the mons to assemble a team and view their synergies.
